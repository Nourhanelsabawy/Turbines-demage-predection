Unplanned downtime of wind turbines can result in a significant loss of revenue and energy and can easily scale to millions of dollars a year. It is therefore pivotal that flagging the failure of components is made to prevent further loss and perform maintenance. It, however, involves the replacement of components and higher costs.
Condition-based monitoring systems rely on supervisory control and data acquisition systems to predict faults and get valuable insights into the turbine’s performance.
